# Maze_Runner


There are three levels in the game, and each level has its own obstacles. To advance, 
players must collect keys that open portals leading to subsequent levels or to the 
imprisoned princess herself. Moving through the labyrinth must be done carefully, 
because evil bees threaten the player in different areas. In addition, an obstacle on the 
player's way will be the appearance of a dragon on the third level. If the player touches 
any enemy on any level, the only way out is to restart the entire game. This means that 
even if the player has reached level 2 or 3 and accidentally touches an enemy, they will 
return to level 1, the starting level.
Our game also features an introductory scene that offers a glimpse into the princess' 
backstory and sets the stage for the upcoming quest. Also, if the player was able to go 
through all the levels and save the princess, he will be taken to the final “You Win!”
scene.

Further immersing the players in the game is the exciting background music that 
accompanies their journey and enhances the overall experience.

framework and creating the structure of the maze. Adapted the maze design to harmonize 
with the overall theme of the game, enhancing its integrity. Also, improved the aesthetics 
of the game by adding a more modern background. Created an engaging cut scene that 
introduces players to the game's story by telling the backstory of the princess. Also,
created a final “You Win” scene that lets the player know the game is over.


**Eyad Alsahori:** Developed a mechanism for collecting and using keys, allowing players 
to open doors after collecting three keys. Also, organized the integration of background 
sound, enriching the atmosphere of the game. Contributed to the visual elements of the 
game, by creating enemy objects and providing PNG images for various in-game objects. 
Also, Eyad implemented a level system consisting of three separate maze levels. This 
allows players to progress smoothly through portals, moving from one level to the next in 
the game.
