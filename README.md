# Maze_Runner


There are three levels in the game, and each level has its own obstacles. To advance, 
players must collect keys that open portals leading to subsequent levels or to the 
imprisoned princess herself. Moving through the labyrinth must be done carefully, 
because evil bees threaten the player in different areas. In addition, an obstacle on the 
player's way will be the appearance of a dragon on the third level. If the player touches 
any enemy on any level, the only way out is to restart the entire game. This means that 
even if the player has reached level 2 or 3 and accidentally touches an enemy, they will 
return to level 1, the starting level.
Our game also features an introductory scene that offers a glimpse into the princess' 
backstory and sets the stage for the upcoming quest. Also, if the player was able to go 
through all the levels and save the princess, he will be taken to the final “You Win!”
scene.
